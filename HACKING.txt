Development
===========

To run the `buildout` of this package copy ``local.cfg.example`` to
``local.cfg`` and edit it to match your needs:

* ``MYSQL_COMMAND_POSTFIX`` is needed if your MySQL commands look like `mysql5`
  instead of `mysql`

* MySQL has to open a port for the tests to connect to. Configure this in your
  `my.cnf`.

Running tests

Install tox_ and run the tests calling ``tox``.
